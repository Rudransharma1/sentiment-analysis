## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing customer sentiment from restaurant reviews using
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The objective is
to automatically classify customer feedback as **positive or negative**, enabling
businesses to better understand customer satisfaction and improve decision-making.

The project implements two complementary approaches:

- **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner)** — a rule-based NLP model
  used as a fast baseline for sentiment classification.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** — a deep learning model designed to capture
  contextual and sequential patterns in text data for improved sentiment prediction.

The end-to-end workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis,
model training, evaluation, and result interpretation. The final outputs provide
clear insights into customer sentiment distribution and highlight the strengths
and limitations of both modeling approaches.

The insights generated from this analysis can help restaurants identify customer
pain points, monitor service quality, and prioritize improvements based on
real customer feedback. This project demonstrates practical application of NLP
and deep learning techniques in a real-world business context.
